# Introduction #

I use this to keep track of coding.

**Important:**
  * help links to wiki help section + more links
  * write some help before I release fully
  * add warp editor
  * nsic sections and unselected
  * patching warning of size: sprites
  * edit overworld paths
  * patching changes checksums (header and rom)

**Good:**

  * colorise pipes from warp
  * header buffer
  * drop down list of tile sets
  * cursor changes
  * add that you can't view patched ROM
  * better error messages, trace back.
  * add importing / exporting tileset
  * round robin status text
  * hex numbers (if x in)
  * show sprite while dragging
  * warning on import to different level
  * select tool only works one way, drag anyway
  * exit: show what changes have been made that will get lost

**OK:**

  * explanation box (hints)
  * batch patch file (maps, sprites everything linked in an .ini)
  * spider diagram program and make better
  * drawing of tile-map shows pattern before displays in wine
  * multi select on global>tilemap editor
  * seperate smart block functions (check boxs)
  * blockdata: per tileset paletting, maybe load psp ini
  * autosave

**No hurry:**

  * edit names in combobox
  * different size icons for everything
  * put all the lables into label1
  * ctrl paint gui
  * icons for tabs
  * center\_on sub, steal code from minimap\_click (fix auto-center when zoomed in + zoom centers on where you zoom)
  * combo-box text not editable
  * combine tile loading of Mario and Wario.
  * better save to ROM (optimise load\_all\_levels)
  * change bubble-sort of sprites to quick-sort
  * patch a level
  * fix generic tiles with palette loading (maybe add that when palette loads it reuses colours already set)
  * HUD editor,music, etc
  * add unzip hits end of line?
  * second credits?
  * polish re-size form,icon,config


**Mario 3:**

  * Wario map names
  * map tiles
  * header!


**Mario 1:**

  * Figure level format
  * find header

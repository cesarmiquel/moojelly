I hope this pleases all the Mario fans!

**Moojelly** started as a level editor for **Super Mario Land 2** that patches the ROM so you can play the levels on the **original** hardware; but now after a ridiculous amount of hours spent coding it does a **whole lot more!**

All I ask is **Please** send me your level hacks and add any bugs to 'issues'.
